# parallelCorpusScript
I created this script so that it can help me scrape data in the future for projects that need parallel corpus, like Translation.
<h1> Dataused </h1>
I used Hunter x Hunter English and Arabic subtitles downloaded from Subscene. 
<h1> Is this data ready to be used? </h1>
No,it isn't; The data is far from being clean, and the script need also some modifications to be general.
<h1> Output </h1>
